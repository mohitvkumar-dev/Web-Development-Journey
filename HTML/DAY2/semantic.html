    <main>Hi, I’m Mohit Kumar, a second-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong focus on becoming a Software Engineer.

My core interest lies in building strong problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, preparing systematically for SDE interviews. Alongside this, I am actively developing skills in Full-Stack Web Development, working on both frontend and backend technologies, and exploring how to integrate AI models and APIs into real-world web applications.

Coming from an ECE background, I maintain clarity in core subjects like digital electronics, signals, communication systems, and basic VLSI concepts — keeping both exams and technical interviews in mind. I aim to blend hardware fundamentals with software expertise to build scalable, intelligent systems.

My short-term goal is to become internship-ready by 2025–2026 by:

Building strong DSA foundations

Developing real-world full-stack + AI projects

Participating in hackathons

Improving professional communication and LinkedIn presence

Long-term, I want career stability with flexibility — strong in core engineering fundamentals but adaptable across software, AI, and system-level domains.

I believe in structured learning, consistent practice, and project-based implementation rather than passive theory.</main>
